在世间，本就是各人下雪，各人有各人的隐晦和皎洁。

Circles and cycles and seasons <br />

For everything there's always reason <br />

But it's never good <br />

Never turns out as it should <br />

No one ever held you <br />

No single moment of truth <br />

But if you were mine <br />

I would've looked into those eyes <br />

And said, <br />

Tell me the words you long to hear <br />

And I'll sing them loud and clear <br />

Let me heal the wounds you've held on to for all these years <br />

Break the cycle <br />

Break the chains <br />

'Cause love is louder than all your pain <br />

Than all your pain <br />

Is it all truly broken? <br />

Irreparable mistakes? <br />

Let's take our time <br />

Don't we have to try? <br />

Too many missing pieces <br />

That's always been your reason <br />

To justify

How you feel inside <br />

I wish you'd say, <br />

Tell me the words you long to hear <br />

And I'll sing them loud and clear <br />

Let me heal the wounds you've held on to for all these years <br />

Break the cycle <br />

Break the chains <br />

Love is louder than all your pain <br />

Break the cycle <br />

Break the chains <br />

Love is louder than all your pain <br />
