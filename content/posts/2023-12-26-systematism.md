## 认知 Cognitively

在强调如何进行体系化的思考之前先强调一下认知问题，这是一切让思考保持正确的从发散到汇总脉络的前提<br>
Before emphasizing how to think systematically, let's emphasize the cognitive issue, which is a prerequisite for everything that keeps thinking in the right vein from diffusion to aggregation

对于一件事物的思考不应该偏离其本质的特性，我用第一性原理来解释<br>
Thinking about a thing should not deviate from its essential properties, which I explain using the first nature principle

> 第一性原理是一种分析问题和推导结论的方法，它基于最基本、不可分解的事实或假设，而不依赖于其他已知结论<br>
> First principles are a method of analyzing problems and deriving conclusions based on the most basic, undecomposable facts or assumptions that do not depend on other known conclusions

提前说明第一性原理和知识迁移的关系，他们之间可能会存在一些冲突，但是我们要避免这种冲突，下文会对知识迁移的思想进行阐述<br>
State in advance the relationship between first principles and knowledge transfer; there may be some conflict between them, but we want to avoid it, and the idea of knowledge transfer is described below

这里存在两种可能，两种让我们对于一件事情的存在错误的分析和判断的可能<br>
There are two possibilities here, two possibilities that allow us to analyze and judge something incorrectly

### 偏离核心要素 Deviation from core elements

对于简单的问题我们通常可以快速且准确的给出判断，但是对于复杂问题就不好说了<br>
For simple problems we can usually give a quick and accurate judgment, but for complex problems it is not so easy to tell

给出自己的思考之前应该明确问题的核心是什么，否则完全背离方向是很有可能的，有点像高考语文审题失败导致 0 分<br>
It should be clear what the core of the question is before giving your own thinking, otherwise a complete deviation from the direction is quite possible, a bit like failing to examine a question in a high school language exam leads to 0 points

在复杂场景中会存在很多的误导需要我们去抽丝剥茧的提取关键信息或者最初的核心目标是什么，所以说我们最应该明确就是这件事情的目的或者动机是什么<br>
In complex scenarios there will be a lot of misdirection we need to extract the key information or the initial core objective is what, so that we should be most clear is the purpose of the matter or what the motive is

那么那些其他信息就不重要了吗？是重要的，误导不是目的，只是因为最初的本质没有抓住，这些信息会作为一些依据或者线索去支撑基于问题核心而进行的思考和分析<br>
So that other information is not important? Yes, it is important, misleading is not the goal, just because the initial essence is not captured, this information will be used as some basis or clue to support the thinking and analysis based on the core of the problem.

假设我们已经抓住了问题的关键点进行剖析，那么如何保证分析得出的结论是准确的呢？就是依靠第一性原理<br>
Assuming we have captured the key points of the problem to dissect, how do we ensure that the conclusions drawn from the analysis are accurate? It's by relying on the first principle

### 已有的信息带来的错误的帮助 The wrong kind of help from information that already exists

我们会因为一些已知的信息反而走向了错误的思考方向，这些已知的信息存在两种：<br>
We can go in the wrong direction of thinking instead because of some known information that exists in two ways:

1. 问题中携带的内容 Content carried in the question
2. 过往经历中的一些经验或者其他知识 Some experience or other knowledge from past experience

关于问题中携带的内容假设我们抓住了问题的核心，那这部分的信息就是正向的帮助了，反之最好的结果也只是带来思考上的困惑，甚至会因为困惑而思维发散到为止错误的方向，像是拿着锤子找钉子，不仅没抓住核心要素反而带着困惑去寻找答案显然效率是极其低下的。这里更多的是解释过往经历中的一些经验或者其他知识帮的倒忙<br>
About the content carried in the question assuming that we grasp the core of the problem, that part of the information is a positive help, the best result of the opposite is only to bring the thinking on the confusion, and even because of the confusion and the thinking dispersed to so far in the wrong direction, like looking for a hammer to find nails, not only did not grasp the core elements but with the confusion to find the answer is obviously extremely inefficient. Here is more of an explanation of past experience in some of the experience or other knowledge to help the reverse

现实中我们是如何记住一个人的呢？<br>
How do we remember someone in reality?

大脑存储的信息是非常有限的，所以针对我们如何记住某人的问题的时候其实我们的大脑做的是特征提取<br>
The brain stores a very limited amount of information, so in response to the question of how we remember someone what our brain actually does is feature extraction<br>
特征提取就是你并没有记住“人”这个对大脑来说特别困难且抽象的事物，大脑存储的是这个人的一个个外在和内在特征：性别、身高、五官、头发颜色、肤色、胖瘦、动态体征等等<br>
Feature extraction means that you don't remember "person", which is a particularly difficult and abstract thing for the brain to remember, but rather the brain stores the person's external and internal features: gender, height, facial features, hair color, skin color, fat, thinness, dynamic signs, and so on.

这解释了问题的同时也带来了一个新的问题：你是有可能认错人的。我们当然可以避免这一点，这要求我们全知全能<br />
This explains the problem and brings up a new one: it is possible for you to recognize the wrong person. We can certainly avoid this, which requires us to be omniscient

你会因为一个人的特征与你记忆中另一个人的特征相符而认错这个人，同样的如果对于一个新鲜事物由于你的对于他的了解和认知是不够的，你会自然的使用过往的一些经验和知识来尝试解释他，这是大脑自然的行为，就像认错人一样你也会因为这些信息导致对于这个事物错误的分析和判断，因为这些信息并不是万事万物通用的真理，它并不置信<br />
You will recognize a person wrongly because their characteristics match the characteristics of another person in your memory, similarly if for a new thing due to your understanding and knowledge is not enough, you will naturally use some of the past experience and knowledge to try to explain it, this is the brain's natural behavior, just like recognizing the wrong person you will also be because of the information to lead to the wrong analysis and judgment of this thing, because this information is not the universal truth of all things, it does not believe in the truth. Because this information is not the universal truth of everything, it does not believe that

如何解决呢？就是利用第一性原理的法则，我们要控制自己基于问题分析上的思考方向，一定是基于理性、客观事实，从问题本身出发不要武断的使用一些个人推测或者相关性感觉比较高的信息辅助<br />
How to solve it? It is the use of the law of first nature principle, we have to control their own thinking direction based on the analysis of the problem, must be based on rationality, objective facts, from the problem itself do not arbitrarily use some personal conjecture or relevance of the feeling of higher information assistance

## 知识迁移：特征提取，如何建立相关性 Knowledge transfer: feature extraction, how to establish correlation

> 知识迁移是指将在一个领域或环境中获得的知识、经验、技能等应用到另一个领域或环境中的过程<br />
> Knowledge transfer is the process of applying knowledge, experience, skills, etc. acquired in one domain or environment to another domain or environment

对于上面的帮倒忙来说一切都是发生在我们对于一个东西进行错误的定性、定量判断的时候，而大部分时候知识迁移的能力是非常重要，非常有助于我们思考的<br />
For the above help everything happens when we make wrong qualitative and quantitative judgments about something, and most of the time the ability to transfer knowledge is very important and very helpful to our thinking<br />
例如我们比较精通一门编程语言之后去学习另一门同类型编程语言会很容易，第二门的学习成本被第一门前置的知识大大的稀释了。从特征提取的角度来回答：语言背后的基础概念都是统一的、设计思想都是大同小异的，只是一些语法、范式的差异<br />
For example, if we are more proficient in one programming language, it will be very easy to learn another programming language of the same type, and the learning cost of the second one is greatly diluted by the knowledge of the first one. Answer from the perspective of feature extraction: the basic concepts behind the language are uniform, the design ideas are similar, but there are only some syntax and paradigm differences.

知识迁移需要长时间大量的原始积累，并且将这些积累在个人脑海中构建出犬牙交错的知识脉络，那么对于知识迁移这里存在两个问题：<br />
Knowledge migration requires a large amount of raw accumulation over a long period of time and the construction of these accumulations in the individual's mind to build a canine knowledge vein, then for knowledge migration here are two problems:

1. 大量的原始积累（这是基础），这些积累的深度和广度取决于后续涉及新知识的时候知识迁移带来辅助的程度 A large number of primary accumulations (this is the foundation), the depth and breadth of these accumulations depends on the extent to which knowledge transfer is aided by the subsequent involvement of new knowledge
2. 脑海中知识脉络的搭建，或者说是不同知识之间的相关性的建联，这部分决定后续对于新事物学习的效率 The building of knowledge in the mind, or the correlation between different knowledge, which partly determines the efficiency of subsequent learning of new things.

基于这两个问题对于对于新事物学习存在两个本质的特征分别是`程度`和`效率`，程度很好理解不做过多解释，那么关于效率呢？<br />
Based on these two questions for the learning of new things there are two essential features are the degree and efficiency, the degree is very good to understand not to do too much explanation, then about the efficiency of it?

对于效率的帮助所要构建的只是脉络的过程是比较困难的，长期积累的基础上需要对自己进行大量相关性的训练，例如如果让你将莎士比亚和晾衣架进行关联，你会如何思考？<br />
For efficiency the process of just the veins to be constructed by the help is more difficult, and a lot of relevance training for yourself is needed on a long term basis, e.g. if you were asked to correlate Shakespeare with a drying rack, how would you think about it?

本质依然是特征提取的问题，而这个建联的训练过程就是强化脑海中知识之间相关性的过程，当你看到一个事物 A 的时候大脑皮层只需要 1ms 就可以快速联想到事物 B、C、D 等等<br />
The essence is still the problem of feature extraction, and the training process of building associations is to strengthen the correlation between the knowledge in the mind, when you see a thing A the cerebral cortex only needs 1ms to quickly associate things B, C, D and so on!

并且这个需要长时间的思考来维持，因为对于大脑的负担来说，本质上设计大脑存储信息的算法也是一个 LRU 的队列，对于新信息的接纳会保持较快的响应，但是对于长久不使用的那部分内容就会逐渐忘记了，可能两万小时理论就是通过强化记忆来解决大脑的这个健忘问题<br />
And this requires a long time to think to maintain, because for the burden of the brain, essentially the algorithm designed for the brain to store information is also a LRU queue, for the acceptance of new information will maintain a faster response, but for a long time not to use that part of the content will gradually forget, may be 20,000 hours of the theory is through the reinforcement of the memory to solve the problem of forgetfulness of the brain!

## 脉络梳理 Vein combing

我们对于问题的思考需要始终保持思维是清晰的、逻辑是自洽的、条理是清晰的<br />
Our thinking about issues needs to be clear, logical and organized at all times

在这个基础上如果我遇到一个很困难的需求我会怎么办？<br />
On top of that what would I do if I had a very difficult requirement?

- 我们需要明确这个需求是为了解决什么问题、价值、必要性、什么样的时间周期需要完成 We need to define what problem this requirement is to solve, the value, the necessity, and what kind of time period it needs to be accomplished
- 所谓的复杂指的是哪些场景？技术难度较高？人力成本较大？排期紧张？服务不稳定？ What scenarios are meant by complexity? Higher technical difficulty? Higher labor costs? Tight scheduling? Unstable service?
- 针对不同困难的场景对应可能的解决方案是什么，不同解决方案面临的问题是什么 What are the possible solutions for different difficult scenarios and what are the problems faced by different solutions?
- 从解决问题的角度出发来看我们可能需要哪些帮助或者支持，包括人力、时间、三方服务等等 Look at what help or support we might need from a problem-solving perspective, including labor, time, third-party services, etc.
- 风险评估 Risk Assessment
- 调研 Research
- 多方案设计 Multi-solution design
- 概念验证 Proof of Concept
- 启动 Launch

上面的这些本身就是脉络梳理的过程，那什么是脉络梳理呢？<br />
All of the above is itself a process of chakra combing, so what is chakra combing?

> 脉络梳理是指将一系列信息、观点或概念有条理地组织起来，形成清晰的结构，以便更好地理解、传达或分析<br>
> Chakra grooming is the process of organizing a set of information, ideas, or concepts in an organized manner to create a clear structure for better understanding, communication, or analysis of

- 明确主题或目标，界定梳理的范围和重点 Clarify the theme or objective and define the scope and focus of the grooming process
- 收集与主题或目标相关的信息，包括人员依赖、三方资源、数据等等 Gather information relevant to the topic or objective, including personnel dependencies, triangulation resources, data, etc.
- 将收集到的信息进行分类，找出相关性强的信息，并且筛选掉不必要或无关的内容 Categorize the collected information to find out what is relevant and filter out unnecessary or irrelevant content.
- 确定逻辑结构： 制定一个逻辑结构，确定信息之间的关系和顺序。可以使用逻辑框图、思维导图等工具来帮助可视化这种结构 Define a logical structure: Develop a logical structure that defines the relationship and order of information. Tools such as block diagrams and mind maps can be used to help visualize this structure.
- 制定大纲 Developing an outline
- 确保各个部分之间有清晰的连接和过渡 Ensure that there are clear connections and transitions between sections
- 在大纲的基础上填充详细的内容。确保每个部分都有足够的信息来支持你的主题或目标 Fill in the details on top of the outline. Make sure each section has enough information to support your topic or objective
- 通过和其他人的交流通过他人的反馈来适当修正 Appropriate corrections are made through communication with others and through feedback from others.

通过这些步骤，你可以更好地组织信息，同时可以借助笔记、画图工具等等使得你的思考过程更为有条理和逻辑<br>
Through these steps, you can better organize your information and make your thinking process more structured and logical with the help of notes, drawing tools and more!

## 关于体系化 About Systematization

一直在说到构建大脑的知识体系或者是知识脉络，那么关于体系化到底是什么<br>
There's been talk about building a body of knowledge or a vein of knowledge in the brain, so what exactly is it about systematization

> 将某个领域、系统或活动进行有序组织、规划和管理的过程。这个过程涉及到将一个复杂的系统或活动划分为不同的组成部分，并建立起彼此之间的关联和相互作用<br>
> The process of organizing, planning and managing an area, system or activity in an orderly manner. This process involves dividing a complex system or activity into its component parts and establishing linkages and interactions between them.

脑海中的知识脉络通过相关性建联联就像 DNA 双螺旋的组蛋白线轴一样捆绑起来我们大概是有了清晰的认知了，所谓体系化也无非如此<br>
Knowledge in the mind through the correlation of building links like DNA double helix of histone spools tied together we probably have a clear understanding of the so-called systematization is no more than that!

对于生活工作上的体系化思考就是将一些些碎片和细节通过相关性进行建联，这里存在两个要求：<br>
Thinking systematically about life and work is about connecting pieces and details through correlation, and there are two requirements here:

1. 相关性建联：特征提取 Correlation building link: feature extraction
2. 视角 Angle on sth

为什么体系化思考会强调和视角的关系？<br>
Why does systematic thinking emphasize the relationship with perspective?

就像战争，局限于一隅之地是无法纵观全局战场的局势的，决策者需要考虑整个战场的动态和局势，而不仅仅是局部战场的情况。只有全面了解整个战场，才能够制定更全面、更有效的战略<br>
Just as in war, it is impossible to look at the situation of the entire battlefield when confined to a single corner, and decision makers need to take into account the dynamics and situation of the entire battlefield, not just the local battlefield. Only with a comprehensive understanding of the entire battlefield can a more comprehensive and effective strategy be developed.

所以我们体系化思考的前提一定是要提高我们的视角<br>
So the premise of our systematic thinking must be to improve our perspectives

## 提高视角 Improvement of perspective

工作的时候有的同学会收到类似过度沉浸在细节没有大局观之类的较为负面的反馈，怎么样是有大局观呢？这里就需要进行视角的提升<br>
When working, some students will receive similar over-immersed in the details without the big picture view of the more negative feedback, how is the big picture view? Here we need to improve the perspective

业务开发中的一线同学很容易陷入需求的细节里面做纯粹的执行者，不断强化自己的螺丝钉属性，这显然是不对的，长久以往个人成长会存在很大的问题。从这个角度来说我认为即使是一线的研发在接业务需求的时候也需要有不同角度的考量：<br>
Business development in the first line of students are very easy to fall into the details of the requirements to do pure implementers, and constantly strengthen their own screw attributes, which is obviously not right, in the long run there will be a big problem of personal growth. From this point of view, I think that even the first-line R & D in the business requirements need to be taken into account from different perspectives:

1. 对于业务这个需求是为了什么目标服务的，需要有一些产品的 sense 参与到业务的思考中来，或许自己的意见也是很有价值的 For the business what goal this requirement is serving, there needs to be some product sense involved in thinking about the business, and perhaps their own opinion is valuable as well
2. 有哪些涉及的相关方、关键时间节点和动作等 What are the relevant parties involved, key time points and actions, etc.?
3. 执行、人力分配、调研、多方案设计、风险评估等等等等 Implementation, manpower allocation, research, multi-programming, risk assessment, etc., etc., etc.
4. ...

不只是说要简单的知道这些内容，而是这些东西是在时刻围绕在我们思考的上下文中的，这里的差别很大<br>
It's not just that it's important to simply know the content, but that these things are in the context that surrounds our thinking at all times, and there's a big difference here

从做事情的角度来说可以主动发起和推进一些比较大规模的技术专项或者业务需求可以很快的让自己在这方面得到提升，这个过程中可以从以下方面获得成长：<br>
From the perspective of doing things can take the initiative to initiate and promote some of the larger-scale technical special or business needs can quickly get themselves in this area to improve, this process can be from the following aspects of growth:

1. 制定规划 Plan
2. 多角度思考 Thinking from multiple perspectives
3. 知识领域的拓宽 Broadening of knowledge areas
4. 不同领域、层次的人员的沟通交流 Communication between people of different fields and levels
5. 大局观 Overall situation
6. ...

要从更广泛、更全面的角度来看待问题，超越狭隘的视野，获得更深刻的理解<br>
To look at issues from a broader and more comprehensive perspective, to transcend narrow horizons and gain a deeper understanding

## 关于本文 About this article

对于应用到具体的事情上，本文就是利用类似的方法进行构思的。当我觉得我想将我看待事情和解决问题的方法总结出一些文字的时候，我基于我想要表达的观念梳理出一些核心的要素，对这些要素的内容进行清晰的阐释，而这个阐释希望是结构化的，从一些关键要素的提炼来分段解释，通过一些案例来支撑<br>
For application to specific things, this paper was conceived utilizing a similar approach. When I feel that I want to summarize my way of looking at things and solving problems in some words, I sort out some core elements based on the concepts I want to express, and provide a clear explanation of the content of these elements, which is hopefully structured, and is explained in segments from the distillation of some key elements, supported by some case studies

这应该是一套方法论，是一套可以运用到生活和工作方方面面的场景的公式<br>
This should be a methodology, a formula that can be applied to scenarios in all aspects of life and work
