### Jump to the hell

Let me share a recurring nightmare I have with you.

In this dream, I was walking alone in the dark on a road without return. There were no signs on the road. Endless time to the end of the road, abyss ahead was dark and silent. Wenn du lange in einen Abgrund blickst, blickt der Abgrund auch dich hinein... So I jumped down like this with endless falling, circling...

That's the good version of the dream. In the other one, there's just ... screaming. And darkness.
